It's completely\nimplemented in javascript, and its goal consists of two things:\n\n1. Reimplement ncurses entirely by parsing and compiling terminfo and termcap,\nand exposing a `Program` object which can output escape sequences compatible\nwith _any_ terminal.\n\n2. Implement a widget API which is heavily optimized for terminals.\n\nThe blessed renderer makes use of CSR (change-scroll-region), and BCE\n(back-color-erase). It draws the screen using the painter's algorithm and is\nsped up with smart cursor movements and a screen damage buffer. This means\nrendering of your application will be extremely efficient: blessed only draws\nthe changes (damage) to the screen.\n\nBlessed is arguably as accurate as ncurses, but even more optimized in some\nways. The widget library gives you an API which is reminiscent of the DOM.\nAnyone is able to make an awesome terminal application with blessed. There are\nterminal widget libraries for other platforms (primarily [python][urwid] and\n[perl][curses-ui]), but blessed is possibly the most DOM-like (dare I say the\nmost user-friendly?).\n\nBlessed has been used to implement other popular libraries and programs.\nExamples include: the [slap text editor][slap] and [blessed-contrib][contrib].\nThe blessed API itself has gone on to inspire [termui][termui] for Go.\n\n## Important Blessed Changes (>0.0.51)\n\n- The absolute `.left` _property_ (not option) has been renamed to `.aleft`.\n  The `.rleft` property has been renamed to `.left`. This should not have much\n  effect on most applications. This includes all other coordinate properties.\n- `autoPadding` is now enabled by default. To revert to the original behavior,\n  pass `autoPadding: false` into the screen object. That being said, it would\n  be wiser to adjust your code to use `autoPadding`. non-`autoPadding` is now\n  considered deprecated.\n\n## Install\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install blessed\n```\n\n## Example\n\nThis will render a box with line borders containing the text `'Hello world!'`,\nperfectly centered horizontally and vertically.\n\n__NOTE__: It is recommend you use either `smartCSR` or `fastCSR` as a\n`blessed.screen` option. `autoPadding` is also recommended; it will\nautomatically offset box content within borders instead of on top of them when\ncoords are `0`. non-`autoPadding` _may_ be deprecated in the future. See the\nAPI documentation for further explanation of these options.\n\n``` js\nvar blessed = require('blessed');\n\n// Create a screen object.\nvar screen = blessed.screen({\n  autoPadding: true,\n  smartCSR: true\n});\n\nscreen.title = 'my window title';\n\n// Create a box perfectly centered horizontally and vertically.\nvar box = blessed.box({\n  top: 'center',\n  left: 'center',\n  width: '50%',\n  height: '50%',\n  content: 'Hello {bold}world{/bold}!',\n  tags: true,\n  border: {\n    type: 'line'\n  },\n  style: {\n    fg: 'white',\n    bg: 'magenta',\n    border: {\n      fg: '#f0f0f0'\n    },\n    hover: {\n      bg: 'green'\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n// Append our box to the screen.\nscreen.append(box);\n\n// Add a PNG icon to the box (X11 only)\nvar icon = blessed.image({\n  parent: box,\n  top: 0,\n  left: 0,\n  width: 'shrink',\n  height: 'shrink',\n  file: __dirname + '/my-program-icon.png',\n  search: false\n});\n\n// If our box is clicked, change the content.\nbox.on('click', function(data) {\n  box.setContent('{center}Some different {red-fg}content{/red-fg}.{/center}');\n  screen.render();\n});\n\n// If box is focused, handle `enter`/`return` and give us some more content.\nbox.key('enter', function(ch, key) {\n  box.setContent('{right}Even different {black-fg}content{/black-fg}.{/right}\\n');\n  box.setLine(1, 'bar');\n  box.insertLine(1, 'foo');\n  screen.render();\n});\n\n// Quit on Escape, q, or Control-C.\nscreen.key(['escape', 'q', 'C-c'], function(ch, key) {\n  return process.exit(0);\n});\n\n// Focus our element.\nbox.focus();\n\n// Render the screen.\nscreen.render();\n```\n\n\n## API Documentation\n\n### Widgets\n\nBlessed comes with a number of high-level widgets so you can avoid all the\nnasty low-level terminal stuff.\n\n- [Node](#node-from-eventemitter)\n- [Screen](#screen-from-node)\n- [Element](#element-from-node)\n- [Box](#box-from-element)\n- [Text](#text-from-element)\n- [Line](#line-from-box)\n- [ScrollableBox](#scrollablebox-from-box)\n- [ScrollableText](#scrollabletext-from-scrollablebox)\n- [List](#list-from-box)\n- [Form](#form-from-box)\n- [Input](#input-from-box)\n- [Textarea](#textarea-from-input)\n- [Textbox](#textbox-from-textarea)\n- [Button](#button-from-input)\n- [ProgressBar](#progressbar-from-input)\n- [FileManager](#filemanager-from-list)\n- [Checkbox](#checkbox-from-input)\n- [RadioSet](#radioset-from-box)\n- [RadioButton](#radiobutton-from-checkbox)\n- [Prompt](#prompt-from-box)\n- [Question](#question-from-box)\n- [Message](#message-from-box)\n- [Loading](#loading-from-box)\n- [Listbar](#listbar-from-box)\n- [Log](#log-from-scrollabletext)\n- [Table](#table-from-box)\n- [ListTable](#listtable-from-list)\n- [Terminal](#terminal-from-box)\n- [Image](#image-from-box)\n- [Layout](#layout-from-element)\n\n\n#### Node (from EventEmitter)\n\nThe base node which everything inherits from.\n\n##### Options:\n\n- __screen__ - the screen to be associated with.\n- __parent__ - the desired parent.\n- __children__ - an arrray of children.\n\n##### Properties:\n\n- inherits all from EventEmitter.\n- __type__ - type of the node (e.g. `box`).\n- __options__ - original options object.\n- __parent__ - parent node.\n- __screen__ - parent screen.\n- __children__ - array of node's children.\n- __data, _, $__ - an object for any miscellanous user data.\n- __index__ - render index (document order index) of the last render call.\n\n##### Events:\n\n- inherits all from EventEmitter.\n- __adopt__ - received when node is added to a parent.\n- __remove__ - received when node is removed from it's current parent.\n- __reparent__ - received when node gains a new parent.\n- __attach__ - received when node is attached to the screen directly or\n  somewhere in its ancestry.\n- __detach__ - received when node is detached from the screen directly or\n  somewhere in its ancestry.\n\n##### Methods:\n\n- inherits all from EventEmitter.\n- __prepend(node)__ - prepend a node to this node's children.\n- __append(node)__ - append a node to this node's children.\n- __remove(node)__ - remove child node from node.\n- __insert(node, i)__ - insert a node to this node's children at index `i`.\n- __insertBefore(node, refNode)__ - insert a node to this node's children\n  before the reference node.\n- __insertAfter(node, refNode)__ - insert a node from node after the reference\n  node.\n- __detach()__ - remove node from its parent.\n- __emitDescendants(type, args..., [iterator])__ - emit event for element, and\n  recursively emit same event for all descendants.\n- __get(name, [default])__ - get user property with a potential default value.\n- __set(name, value)__ - set user property to value.\n\n\n#### Screen (from Node)\n\nThe screen on which every other node renders.\n\n##### Options:\n\n- __program__ - the blessed `Program` to be associated with. will be\n  automatically instantiated if none is provided.\n- __smartCSR__ - attempt to perform CSR optimization on all possible elements\n  (not just full-width ones, elements with uniform cells to their sides).\n  this is known to cause flickering with elements that are not full-width,\n  however, it is more optimal for terminal rendering.\n- __fastCSR__ - do CSR on any element within 20 cols of the screen edge on\n  either side. faster than `smartCSR`, but may cause flickering depending on\n  what is on each side of the element.\n- __useBCE__ - attempt to perform `back_color_erase` optimizations for terminals\n  that support it. it will also work with terminals that don't support it, but\n  only on lines with the default background color. as it stands with the current\n  implementation, it's uncertain how much terminal performance this adds at the\n  cost of overhead within node.\n- __resizeTimeout__ - amount of time (in ms) to redraw the screen after the\n  terminal is resized (default: 300).\n- __tabSize__ - the width of tabs within an element's content.\n- __autoPadding__ - automatically position child elements with border and\n  padding in mind (__NOTE__: this is a recommended option. it may become\n  default in the future).\n- __artificialCursor__ - have blessed draw a custom cursor and hide the\n  terminal cursor (__experimental__).\n- __cursorShape__ - shape of the artificial cursor. can be: block, underline,\n  or line.\n- __cursorBlink__ - whether the artificial cursor blinks.\n- __cursorColor__ - color of the artificial color. accepts any valid color\n  value (`null` is default).\n- __log__ - create a log file. see `log` method.\n- __dump__ - dump all output and input to desired file. can be used together\n  with `log` option if set as a boolean.\n- __debug__ - debug mode. enables usage of the `debug` method. also creates a\n  debug console which will display when pressing F12. it will display all log\n  and debug messages.\n- __ignoreLocked__ - Array of keys in their full format (e.g. `C-c`) to ignore\n  when keys are locked. Useful for creating a key that will _always_ exit no\n  matter whether the keys are locked.\n- __dockBorders__ - automatically \"dock\" borders with other elements instead of\n  overlapping, depending on position (__experimental__). for example:\n  These border-overlapped elements:\n```\n┌─────────┌─────────┐\n│ box1    │ box2    │\n└─────────└─────────┘\n```\n  Become:\n```\n┌─────────┬─────────┐\n│ box1    │ box2    │\n└─────────┴─────────┘\n```\n- __ignoreDockContrast__ - normally, dockable borders will not dock if the\n  colors or attributes are different. this option will allow them to dock\n  regardless. it may produce some odd looking multi-colored borders though.\n- __fullUnicode__ - allow for rendering of East Asian double-width characters,\n  utf-16 surrogate pairs, and unicode combining characters. this allows you to\n  display text above the basic multilingual plane. this is behind an option\n  because it may affect performance slightly negatively. without this option\n  enabled, all double-width, surrogate pair, and combining characters will be\n  replaced by `'??'`, `'?'`, `''` respectively. (NOTE: iTerm2 cannot display\n  combining characters properly. blessed simply removes them from an element's\n  content if iTerm2 is detected).\n\n##### Properties:\n\n- inherits all from Node.\n- __program__ - the blessed Program object.\n- __tput__ - the blessed Tput object (only available if you passed `tput: true`\n  to the Program constructor.)\n- __focused__ - top of the focus history stack.\n- __width__ -

This is a chicken-and-egg\nproblem: blessed cannot calculate the width and height dynamically _before_ the\nchildren are positioned.\n\n`border` and `padding` are already calculated into the `coords` object the\n`renderer` receives, so there is no need to account for it in your renderer.\n\nTry to set position for children using `el.position`. `el.position` is the most\nprimitive \"to-be-rendered\" way to set coordinates. Setting `el.left` directly\nhas more dynamic behavior which may interfere with rendering.\n\nSome definitions for `coords` (otherwise known as `el.lpos`):\n\n- `coords.xi` - the absolute x coordinate of the __left__ side of a rendered\n  element. it is absolute: relative to the screen itself.\n- `coords.xl` - the absolute x coordinate of the __right__ side of a rendered\n  element. it is absolute: relative to the screen itself.\n- `coords.yi` - the absolute y coordinate of the __top__ side of a rendered\n  element. it is absolute: relative to the screen itself.\n- `coords.yl` - the absolute y coordinate of the __bottom__ side of a rendered\n  element. it is absolute: relative to the screen itself.\n\nNote again: the `coords` the renderer receives for the Layout already has\nborder and padding subtracted, so you do not have to account for these. The\nchildren do not.\n\n###### Example\n\nHere is an example of how to provide a renderer. Note that this is also the\ndefault renderer if none is provided. This renderer will render each child as\nthough they were `display: inline-block;` in CSS, as if there were a\ndynamically sized horizontal grid from left to right.\n\n``` js\nvar layout = blessed.layout({\n  parent: screen,\n  top: 'center',\n  left: 'center',\n  width: '50%',\n  height: '50%',\n  border: 'line',\n  style: {\n    bg: 'red',\n    border: {\n      fg: 'blue'\n    }\n  },\n  // NOTE: This is already the default renderer if none is provided!\n  renderer: function(coords) {\n    var self = this;\n\n    // The coordinates of the layout element\n    var width = coords.xl - coords.xi\n      , height = coords.yl - coords.yi\n      , xi = coords.xi\n      , xl = coords.xl\n      , yi = coords.yi\n      , yl = coords.yl;\n\n    // The current row offset in cells (which row are we on?)\n    var rowOffset = 0;\n\n    // The index of the first child in the row\n    var rowIndex = 0;\n\n    return function iterator(el, i) {\n      // Make our children shrinkable. If they don't have a height, for\n      // example, calculate it for them.\n      el.shrink = true;\n\n      // Find the previous rendered child's coordinates\n      var last = self.getLastCoords(i);\n\n      // If there is no previously rendered element, we are on the first child.\n      if (!last) {\n        el.position.left = 0;\n        el.position.top = 0;\n      } else {\n        // Otherwise, figure out where to place this child. We'll start by\n        // setting it's `left`/`x` coordinate to right after the previous\n        // rendered element. This child will end up directly to the right of it.\n        el.position.left = last.xl - xi;\n\n        // If our child does not overlap the right side of the Layout, set it's\n        // `top`/`y` to the current `rowOffset` (the coordinate for the current\n        // row).\n        if (el.position.left + el.width <= width) {\n          el.position.top = rowOffset;\n        } else {\n          // Otherwise we need to start a new row and calculate a new\n          // `rowOffset` and `rowIndex` (the index of the child on the current\n          // row).\n          rowOffset += self.children.slice(rowIndex, i).reduce(function(out, el) {\n            if (!self.isRendered(el)) return out;\n            out = Math.max(out, el.lpos.yl - el.lpos.yi);\n            return out;\n          }, 0);\n          rowIndex = i;\n          el.position.left = 0;\n          el.position.top = rowOffset;\n        }\n      }\n\n      // If our child overflows the Layout, do not render it!\n      // Disable this feature for now.\n      if (el.position.top + el.height > height) {\n        // Returning false tells blessed to ignore this child.\n        // return false;\n      }\n    };\n  }\n});\n\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  blessed.box({\n    parent: layout,\n    width: i % 2 === 0 ? 10 : 20,\n    height: i % 2 === 0 ? 5 : 10,\n    border: 'line'\n  });\n}\n```\n\n\n### Artificial Cursors\n\nTerminal cursors can be tricky. They all have different custom escape codes to\nalter. As an _experimental_ alternative, blessed can draw a cursor for you,\nallowing you to have a custom cursor that you control.\n\n``` js\nvar screen = blessed.screen({\n  cursor: {\n    artificial: true,\n    shape: 'line',\n    blink: true,\n    color: null // null for default\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThat's it. It's controlled the same way as the regular cursor.\n\nTo create a custom cursor:\n\n``` js\nvar screen = blessed.screen({\n  cursor: {\n    artificial: true,\n    shape: {\n      bg: 'red',\n      fg: 'white',\n      bold: true,\n      ch: '#'\n    },\n    blink: true\n  }\n});\n```\n\n\n### Positioning\n\nOffsets may be a number, a percentage (e.g. `50%`), or a keyword (e.g.\n`center`).\n\nDimensions may be a number, or a percentage (e.g. `50%`).\n\nPositions are treated almost _exactly_ the same as they are in CSS/CSSOM when\nan element has the `position: absolute` CSS property.\n\nWhen an element is created, it can be given coordinates in its constructor:\n\n``` js\nvar box = blessed.box({\n  left: 'center',\n  top: 'center',\n  bg: 'yellow',\n  width: '50%',\n  height: '50%'\n});\n```\n\nThis tells blessed to create a box, perfectly centered __relative to its\nparent__, 50% as wide and 50% as tall as its parent.\n\nPercentages can also have offsets applied to them:\n\n``` js\n  ...\n  height: '50%-1',\n  left: '45%+1',\n  ...\n```\n\nTo access the calculated offsets, relative to the parent:\n\n``` js\nconsole.log(box.left);\nconsole.log(box.top);\n```\n\nTo access the calculated offsets, absolute (relative to the screen):\n\n``` js\nconsole.log(box.aleft);\nconsole.log(box.atop);\n```\n\n#### Overlapping offsets and dimensions greater than parents'\n\nThis still needs to be tested a bit, but it should work.\n\n\n### Content\n\nEvery element can have text content via `setContent`. If `tags: true` was\npassed to the element's constructor, the content can contain tags. For example:\n\n``` js\nbox.setContent('hello {red-fg}{green-bg}{bold}world{/bold}{/green-bg}{/red-fg}');\n```\n\nTo make this more concise `{/}` cancels all character attributes.\n\n``` js\nbox.setContent('hello {red-fg}{green-bg}{bold}world{/}');\n```\n\nTags can also use hex colors (which will be reduced to the most accurate\nterminal color):\n\n``` js\nbox.setContent('{#ff0000-fg}{bold}red and bold{/}');\n```\n\nNewlines and alignment are also possible in content.\n\n``` js\nbox.setContent('hello\\n'\n  + '{right}world{/right}\\n'\n  + '{center}foo{/center}\\n');\n  + 'left{|}right');\n```\n\nThis will produce a box that looks like:\n\n```\n| hello                 |\n|                 world |\n|          foo          |\n| left            right |\n```\n\nContent can also handle SGR escape codes. This means if you got output from a\nprogram, say `git log` for example, you can feed it directly to an element's\ncontent and the colors will be parsed appropriately.\n\nThis means that while `{red-fg}foo{/red-fg}` produces `^[[31mfoo^[[39m`, you\ncould just feed `^[[31mfoo^[[39m` directly to the content.\n\n\n### Event Bubbling\n\nEvents can bubble in blessed. For example:\n\nReceiving all click events for `box`:\n\n``` js\nbox.on('click', function(mouse) {\n  box.setContent('You clicked ' + mouse.x + ', ' + mouse.y + '.');\n  screen.render();\n});\n```\n\nReceiving all click events for `box`, as well as all of its children:\n\n``` js\nbox.on('element click', function(el, mouse) {\n  box.setContent('You clicked '\n    + el.type + ' at ' + mouse.x + ', ' + mouse.y + '.');\n  screen.render();\n  if (el === box) {\n    return false; // Cancel propagation.\n  }\n});\n```\n\n`el` gets passed in as the first argument. It refers to the target element the\nevent occurred on. Returning `false` will cancel propagation up the tree.\n\n\n### Rendering\n\nTo actually render the screen buffer, you must call `render`.\n\n``` js\nbox.setContent('Hello {#0fe1ab-fg}world{/}.');\nscreen.render();\n```\n\nElements are rendered with the lower elements in the children array being\npainted first. In terms of the painter's algorithm, the lowest indicies in the\narray are the furthest away, just like in the DOM.\n\n\n### Windows compatibility\n\nCurrently there is no `mouse` or `resize` event support on Windows.\n\nWindows users will need to explicitly set `term` when creating a screen like so\n(__NOTE__: This is no longer necessary as of the latest versions of blessed.\nThis is now handled automatically):\n\n``` js\nvar screen = blessed.screen({ term: 'windows-ansi' });\n```\n\n\n### Testing\n\nMost tests contained in the `test/` directory are interactive. It's up to the\nprogrammer to determine whether the test is properly displayed. In the future\nit might be better to do something similar to vttest.\n\n\n## Lower-Level Usage\n\nThis will actually parse the xterm terminfo and compile every\nstring capability to a javascript function:\n\n``` js\nvar blessed = require('blessed');\n\nvar tput = blessed.tput({\n  terminal: 'xterm-256color',\n  extended: true\n});\n\nprocess.stdout.write(tput.setaf(4) + 'Hello' + tput.sgr0() + '\\n');\n```\n\nTo play around with it on the command line, it works just like tput:\n\n``` bash\n$ tput.js setaf 2\n$ tput.js sgr0\n$ echo \"$(tput.js setaf 2)Hello World$(tput.js sgr0)\"\n```\n\nThe main functionality is exposed in the main `blessed` module:\n\n``` js\nvar blessed = require('blessed')\n  , program = blessed.program();\n\nprogram.key('q', function(ch, key) {\n  program.clear();\n  program.disableMouse();\n  program.showCursor();\n  program.normalBuffer();\n  process.exit(0);\n});\n\nprogram.on('mouse', function(data) {\n  if (data.action === 'mousemove') {\n    program.move(data.x, data.y);\n    program.bg('red');\n    program.write('x');\n    program.bg('!red');\n  }\n});\n\nprogram.alternateBuffer();\nprogram.enableMouse();\nprogram.hideCursor();\nprogram.clear();\n\nprogram.move(1, 1);\nprogram.bg('black');\nprogram.write('Hello world', 'blue fg');\nprogram.setx((program.cols / 2 | 0) - 4);\nprogram.down(5);\nprogram.write('Hi again!');\nprogram.bg('!black');\nprogram.feed();\n```\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n1. Why doesn't the Linux console render lines correctly on Ubuntu?\n  - You need to install the `ncurses-base` package __and__ the `ncurses-term`\n    package. (#98)\n2. Why do vertical lines look chopped up in iTerm2?\n  - All ACS vertical lines look this way in iTerm2 with the default font.\n3. Why can't I use my mouse in Terminal.app?\n  - Terminal.app does not support mouse events.\n4. Why doesn't the Image element appear in my terminal?\n  - The Image element uses w3m to display images. This generally only works on\n    X11+xterm/urxvt, but it _may_ work on other unix terminals.\n5. Why can't my mouse clicks register beyond 255 cells?\n  - Older versions of VTE do not support any modern mouse protocol. On top of\n    that, the old X10 protocol it _does_ implement is bugged. Through several\n    workarounds we've managed to get the cell limit from `127` to `255`. If\n    you're not happy with this, you may want to look into using xterm or urxvt,\n    or a terminal which uses a modern VTE, like gnome-terminal.\n6. Is blessed efficient?\n  - Yes. Blessed implements CSR and uses the painter's algorithm to render the\n    screen. It maintains two screen buffers so it only needs to render what\n    has changed on the terminal screen.\n7. Will blessed work with all terminals?\n  - Yes. blessed has a terminfo/termcap parser and compiler that was written\n    from scratch. It should work with every terminal as long as a terminfo\n    file is provided. If you notice any compatibility issues in your termial,\n    do not hesitate to post an issue.\n8. What is \"curses\" and \"ncurses\"?\n  - [\"curses\"][curses] was an old library written in the early days of unix\n    which allowed a programmer to easily manipulate the cursor in order to\n    render the screen. [\"ncurses\"][ncurses] is a free reimplementation of\n    curses. It improved upon it quite a bit by focusing more on terminal\n    compatibility and is now the standard library for implementing terminal\n    programs. Blessed uses neither of these, and instead handles terminal\n    compatibility itself.\n9. What is the difference between blessed and blessed-contrib?\n  - blessed is a major piece of code which reimplements curses from the ground\n    up. A UI API is then layered on top of this. [blessed-contrib][contrib] is\n    a popular library built on top of blessed which makes clever use of modules\n    to implement useful widgets like graphs, ascii art, and so on.\n10. Are there blessed-like solutions for non-javascript platforms?\n  - Yes. There are some fantastic solutions out there.\n    - Perl: [Curses::UI][curses-ui]\n    - Python: [Urwid][urwid]\n    - Go: [termui][termui] & [termbox-go][termbox]\n\n\n## Contribution and License Agreement\n\nIf you contribute code to this project, you are implicitly allowing your code\nto be distributed under the MIT license.
